# Realms of Eldor - Change Log

## 2025-10-03 - Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)

### Project Structure
- Created complete folder structure for Unity project following recommended architecture

### Unit Tests
Comprehensive test coverage for core logic:
- **HeroTests.cs**: 15 tests covering experience, movement, spells, skills, mana
- **ArmyTests.cs**: 14 tests covering creature management, merging, limits
- **GameStateTests.cs**: 16 tests covering initialization, turns, heroes, victory
- **ResourceTests.cs**: 8 tests covering resource operations and player payments

### Documentation

✅ Write unit tests for core logic

**Total Files Created**: 21
**Total Lines of Code**: ~2500+

**Next Phase**: Phase 2 - Data Layer (ScriptableObjects for creatures, heroes, spells)

---

## 2025-10-03 - Phase 2: Data Layer (Complete)

  - Visual and audio asset references

- **HeroTypeData.cs**: Hero type definition ScriptableObject
  - Starting primary stats (attack, defense, spell power, knowledge)
  - Primary stat growth probabilities (customizable per class)
  - Starting army configuration (creature stacks with min/max counts)
  - Starting secondary skills with levels
  - Starting spells and spellbook flag
  - Hero specialty system
  - InitializeHero method to set up hero instances
  - RollPrimaryStatIncrease for leveling

  - Battle and adventure map casting flags
  - Spell effects with base power and scaling
  - Damage/healing calculation methods
  - Can cast validation (checks hero prerequisites)
  - Visual and audio asset references

### Database Managers
- **CreatureDatabase.cs**: Creature lookup singleton
  - Dictionary-based fast lookup by ID
  - Query by faction, tier, or both
  - GetAllCreatures, GetRandomCreature methods
  - Editor helpers for database management
  - DontDestroyOnLoad singleton pattern

- **HeroDatabase.cs**: Hero type lookup singleton
  - Dictionary-based fast lookup by ID
  - Query by class or faction
  - GetRandomHeroType method for procedural generation
  - Editor helpers for database refresh

- **SpellDatabase.cs**: Spell lookup singleton
  - Dictionary-based fast lookup by ID
  - Query by school, level, or both
  - Filter battle vs adventure map spells
  - GetRandomSpell method

### Sample Data Generator (Editor Tool)
- **SampleDataGenerator.cs**: Unity Editor window tool
  - Menu: "Realms of Eldor/Generate Sample Data"
  - One-click generation of sample creatures, heroes, and spells
  - Creates ScriptableObject assets in appropriate folders

**Generated Sample Data:**
- **10 Creatures** across 3 factions:
  - Castle: Peasant, Halberdier, Archer, Marksman, Griffin, Royal Griffin (Tiers 1-3)
  - Rampart: Centaur, Dwarf (Tiers 1-2)
  - Tower: Gremlin (Tier 1)
  - Neutral: Gold Golem (Tier 4)
  - All with HOMM3-accurate stats

- **2 Heroes**:
  - Sir Roland (Knight, Castle) - Melee specialist, no spellbook
  - Solmyr (Wizard, Tower) - Magic specialist, starts with spellbook
  - Both with appropriate stat growth curves

- **5 Spells**:
  - Magic Arrow (Level 1, damage)
  - Haste (Level 1, buff)
  - Cure (Level 2, heal)
  - Fireball (Level 3, damage)
  - Town Portal (Level 5, adventure map teleport)

### Phase 2 Deliverables (All Complete)
✅ Create ScriptableObject classes (CreatureData, HeroTypeData, SpellData)
✅ Implement database manager singletons (3 databases)
✅ Create 5-10 sample creatures (10 creatures, 3 factions)
✅ Create 2-3 sample heroes (2 heroes with different playstyles)
✅ Create sample spells (5 spells covering damage, buff, heal, teleport)
✅ Editor tool for data generation

**Total Files Created (Phase 2)**: 9
**Total Lines of Code (Phase 2)**: ~1500+
**Total Project Files**: 30
**Total Project LOC**: ~4000+

### Bug Fixes
- **Position.cs**: Removed Unity dependencies from Core assembly
  - Position is now pure C# with no UnityEngine references
  - Uses System.Math instead of Mathf for calculations
  - Maintains Core assembly's `noEngineReferences: true` principle

- **PositionExtensions.cs**: Created new Utilities assembly
  - Extension methods for Unity type conversions (ToVector2Int, ToVector3, ToPosition)
  - Utilities.asmdef created with Unity references allowed
  - Controllers and UI assemblies updated to reference Utilities
  - Follows VCMI separation: pure logic in Core, Unity integration in separate layer

**Total Files Created (with fixes)**: 11
**Total Project Files**: 32
**Total Project LOC**: ~4100+

**Next Phase**: Phase 3 - Map System (GameMap, Tilemap rendering, pathfinding)

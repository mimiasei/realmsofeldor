# Claude Development Instructions

This file contains development commands and instructions for working with Realms of Eldor in Claude Code.

This will build and immediately run the ASCII version of the game for testing.
- the entire vcmi repo has been downloaded to /tmp/vcmi-temp
- always reference the vcmi repo for code, realms of eldor is mainly reusing the code from there.
- always add summary of changes to the changes file, but keep it brief
- copy and thus reuse as much of the code from the vcmi repo on github as possible. do not reinvent the wheel!
- after having done a research task on a given subject, summarize all findings in the RESEARCH.md file for later reference
- always use var when compiler infers variable's type anyway (f.ex. int)

- ✅ Mine info displays: resource type, production, owner status, guard status
- ✅ Monster info displays: creature type, count, battle hints
- ✅ Treasure info displays: experience reward, collection status
- ✅ Resource pile info displays: resource type, amount, collection status
- ✅ Clean UI with semi-transparent background overlay

## Update 4: Graphics Implementation Roadmap

### Graphics System Implementation Plan

This roadmap outlines the implementation of a basic SDL2 graphics system for Realms of Eldoria, following VCMI architectural patterns. The implementation will start with minimal assets at 1080p-ready resolution.

#### Phase 1: Graphics Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Strategy: Copy and adapt code directly from VCMI repository**

- [ ] **Asset Management System**
  - [ ] Copy `client/render/IImage.h` from VCMI → `lib/render/IImage.h`
  - [ ] Copy `client/render/Canvas.h/.cpp` from VCMI → `lib/render/Canvas.h/.cpp`
  - [ ] Copy `client/render/Graphics.h/.cpp` from VCMI → `lib/render/Graphics.h/.cpp`
  - [ ] Copy `client/render/CBitmapHandler.h/.cpp` for image loading
  - [ ] Simplify copied code: remove H3-specific formats, keep PNG/BMP support only
  - [ ] Add SDL2_image dependency for PNG support
  - [ ] Adapt for simplified asset paths (no mod system initially)

- [ ] **Screen & Rendering Infrastructure**
  - [ ] Copy `client/render/IScreenHandler.h` from VCMI
  - [ ] Copy `client/renderSDL/SDLImage.h/.cpp` for SDL2 image wrapper
  - [ ] Copy `client/renderSDL/SDL_Extensions.h/.cpp` for SDL utilities
  - [ ] Adapt screen handler for 1920x1080 default resolution
  - [ ] Remove unnecessary complexity (keep basic blitting only)

#### Phase 2: Map Rendering (Week 3-4)
**Strategy: Adapt VCMI's adventure map rendering code**

- [ ] **Adventure Map Infrastructure**
  - [ ] Copy `client/adventureMap/AdventureMapWidget.h/.cpp` from VCMI
  - [ ] Copy `client/adventureMap/MapView.h/.cpp` for camera/viewport
  - [ ] Copy `client/adventureMap/MapRenderer.h/.cpp` for tile rendering

  - [ ] Adapt coordinate system for our simplified GameMap structure

- [ ] **Map Rendering Components**
  - [ ] Copy relevant parts of VCMI's terrain rendering logic
  - [ ] Adapt to our TerrainType enum (8 types vs VCMI's terrain system)
  - [ ] Create placeholder terrain sprites (128x128px for 1080p sharpness)
  - [ ] Copy object rendering system from VCMI
  - [ ] Map our ObjectType enum to VCMI's rendering pipeline

- [ ] **Camera & Interaction**
  - [ ] Copy VCMI's map scrolling logic (keyboard/mouse edge scrolling)

  - [ ] Copy creature queue display
  - [ ] Adapt to our auto-battle system (much simpler than VCMI's tactical mode)
  - [ ] Show battle log/results using VCMI's info window system

#### Asset Requirements Summary

**Minimum Asset Set for MVP (1080p-ready quality):**

Terrain Tiles (128x128px each):
- Dirt, Sand, Grass, Snow, Swamp, Rough, Lava, Water (8 total)

Map Objects (high-res placeholders):
- Hero (64x64 or 96x96px)
- Town (128x128px or 192x192px)
- Mine (96x96px or 128x128px)
- Monster (64x64 or 96x96px)
- Resource pile (48x48 or 64x64px)
- Tree/decoration (64x64 or 96x96px)

UI Assets:
- Panel backgrounds (stretchable 9-patch or solid fills)
- Resource icons (64x64px each, 7 types)
- Button states (normal, hover, pressed)
- Font (TTF, clean and readable)

Battle Assets (if Phase 5 included):
- Battlefield background (1920x1080px)
- Creature battle sprites (96x96px or 128x128px)
- UI elements (buttons, panels)

**Asset Strategy:**
- Start with simple geometric/solid color placeholders
- Gradually replace with pixel art or free assets from OpenGameArt/Kenney.nl
- Keep consistent art style (recommend 2D pixel art or low-poly 3D renders)
- All assets should be 2x or 3x native size for crisp 1080p display

#### Technical Notes

**Key VCMI Code to Reuse:**
- **Rendering Core**: Canvas, IImage, Graphics, SDL_Extensions → copy directly
- **GUI Framework**: CIntObject, EventDispatcher, WindowHandler, widgets → copy and simplify
- **Adventure Map**: AdventureMapInterface, MapView, MapRenderer → copy and adapt to our GameMap
- **Battle Interface**: BattleInterface, BattleRenderer → copy and adapt to our BattleEngine
- **Asset Loading**: Image loaders, resource caching → copy but simplify (no .lod/.def formats)

**Performance Targets:**
- 60 FPS at 1080p resolution
- <100ms asset loading times
- Smooth scrolling and transitions
- Efficient dirty rectangle rendering

#### Success Criteria

**Minimum Viable Graphics (End of Phase 4):**

- **Objects**: Yellow mines, red monster groups rendered as colored squares (16×16px)
- **Heroes**: Cyan squares with white borders (12×12px) at positions (5,7) and (12,8)
- **Smooth scrolling**: Arrow keys move camera one tile at a time
- **Large viewport**: 60×32 tiles visible on 1920×1080 screen (32×32px tiles)

### Phase 2 Enhancement: Zoom System Added

#### Map Zoom Implementation (Completed)
- ✅ **128x128 Base Tiles** - All terrain tiles generated at high resolution
- ✅ **Dynamic Zoom Levels** - Three zoom levels: 32px, 64px, 128px
- ✅ **SDL_BlitScaled** - Efficient tile scaling from base 128x128 to current zoom
- ✅ **Zoom Controls**:
  - `+/=` keys or mouse wheel up: Zoom in (64→128px, shows 15×8 tiles)
  - `-` key or mouse wheel down: Zoom out (64→32px, shows 60×33 tiles)
  - Default: 64px tiles showing 30×17 tiles on 1920×1080 screen
- ✅ **Adaptive UI** - Objects and heroes scale proportionally with zoom level
- ✅ **Viewport Recalculation** - Visible tile count adjusts dynamically per zoom

#### Technical Details
- **Base tile size**: 128×128px (stored in assets)
- **Min zoom**: 32px (strategic overview, see entire 40×25 map)
- **Default zoom**: 64px (balanced view)
- **Max zoom**: 128px (detailed view, 1:1 pixel ratio)

The zoom system provides smooth scaling from strategic overview to detailed close-up view while maintaining performance at 60 FPS.
